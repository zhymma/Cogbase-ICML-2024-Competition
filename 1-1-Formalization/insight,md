Based on the examples provided, here are some insights (insight list) for translating informal problems and their solutions into formal solutions using Lean 3:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:
   - Always start by importing any necessary libraries that provide definitions and theorems relevant to the problem domain.
     ```lean
     import data.real.basic
     ```

2. **Define Variables**:
   - Clearly define all variables used in the problem, specifying their types.
     ```lean
     variables (x : ℝ)
     ```

3. **Formalize Functions and Equations**:
   - Translate informal functions and equations into Lean definitions.
     ```lean
     def R : real × real → real := λ x, 10*x.1^2*x.2 - 5*x.1*x.2^2 + 3*x.1 + 4*x.2
     ```

4. **Use Lean Tactics for Proofs**:
   - Use tactics such as `ring`, `simp`, `norm_num`, etc., to prove statements.
     ```lean
     theorem factorization : (x - 3) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 - 6 * x + 9 :=
     begin
       ring,
     end
     ```

5. **Formalize Partial Derivatives**:
   - When dealing with multivariable functions, define partial derivatives explicitly.
     ```lean
     def DpR : real × real → real := λ x, 20*x.1*x.2 - 5*x.2^2 + 3
     ```

6. **Represent Mathematical Operations**:
   - Represent operations like matrix multiplication, dot products, and transformations formally.
     ```lean
     def new_position := mul_vec transformation original_position
     ```

7. **Define Linear Equations and Sequences**:
   - Use Lean to define linear equations and sequences, ensuring that the domain and range are correctly specified.
     ```lean
     def f (x : ℕ) : ℕ := 7 + 2 * (x - 1)
     ```

8. **Prove Statements and Solve Equations**:
   - Use Lean’s proof mechanisms to verify the correctness of solutions and solve equations.
     ```lean
     example : J 4 = M 4 :=
     begin
       unfold J,
       unfold M,
       norm_num,
     end
     ```

9. **Use Evaluation for Concrete Calculations**:
   - Use the `#eval` command to perform concrete calculations and evaluate expressions.
     ```lean
     #eval new_position
     -- Output: ![8, 18]
     ```

10. **Formalize Geometric Concepts**:
    - Translate geometric concepts like areas and dimensions into Lean.
      ```lean
      def original_area : ℝ := 8 * 6
      ```

11. **Utilize Lean’s Built-in Commands**:
    - Leverage Lean’s built-in commands and tactics to simplify and automate parts of the proof.
      ```lean
      apply nat.succ_eq_add_one,
      ```

These insights can serve as a guide for systematically formalizing mathematical problems and their solutions in Lean 3.
