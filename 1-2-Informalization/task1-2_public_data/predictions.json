        "solution": "The position of a boat on a river is given by the function s(t) = 5t, where t represents the time in minutes since the boat started moving. To find the position of the boat at t = 5 minutes, we substitute t = 5 into the function s(t) = 5 * t. Therefore, the position of the boat at t = 5 minutes is s(5) = 5 * 5 = 25."

        "solution": "Let's denote the number of weeks John has been saving as x. Initially, John had $50 saved, and he is adding $30 to his savings each week. \n\nTo find out if John has enough money to buy the bike that costs $200, we need to compare his total savings with the cost of the bike. \n\nTherefore, the total savings equation is given by: Total savings = $50 + $30 * x, where x represents the number of weeks John has been saving.\n\nTo prove that John's savings are enough to buy the bike, we need to show that Total savings ≥ $200. If we substitute the values, we get: $50 + $30 * x ≥ $200.\n\nBy solving this inequality, we can find the minimum number of weeks John needs to save to afford the bike."
