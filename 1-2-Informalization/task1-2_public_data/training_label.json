How many square feet is the garden plot?",
        "informal_proof": "1. The center of the plot is the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates. So, the x-coordinate of the center is (0+12)/2 = 6 and the y-coordinate of the center is (0+8)/2 = 4. Therefore, the center of the plot is at (6,4).\n\n2. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. Here, the length is 12 feet and the width is 8 feet, so the area is 12*8 = 96 square feet.

In a linear relationship, the slope can be found by choosing any two points and dividing the change in y (the test score) by the change in x (the hours spent studying). \n\nUsing the first two points as an example, we can calculate the slope as follows:\n\n   (70 - 65) / (2 - 1) = 5\n\nSo, the slope of the line is 5. \n\nThis means that for each additional hour spent studying, the test score is expected to increase by 5 points.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the y-intercept of the line. This is the test score when the number of hours spent studying is zero. From the given points, we can see that the y-intercept is 60, because when we extrapolate the line to the point where x=0, y will be 60. \n\nSo, the equation of the line that best fits the data is y = 5x + 60.\n\n3. Now, let's use this equation to predict the test score for a student who studies for 7 hours.

        "informal_proof": "Initially, the perfume was 3/4 full, which is equivalent to 75%. After a week, the perfume was 50% full. The percentage of the perfume used by Sally is the initial amount minus the final amount, which is 75% - 50% = 25%. Therefore, Sally used 25% of the perfume in a week. Converting this percentage to a fraction, we get 25/100 = 1/4. Hence, Sally used 1/4 of the perfume in a week."

So, Alice can always leave a pile with an odd number of factors to Bob until the last marble. The odd number of factors is crucial because it ensures that one of the factors is a square root, which is the only factor that can't be paired with another different factor.

According to the problem, the length of the garden is 3 meters more than twice its width, which can be written as \"2w + 3\". The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width, so we can form the equation \"w*(2w + 3) = 70\". \n\nSolving this equation gives us the width as follows:\nFirst, distribute the w into the parentheses: 2w^2 + 3w = 70. \nThen, rearrange the equation to set it equal to zero: 2w^2 + 3w - 70 = 0. \nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula: w = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). \nIn this case, a = 2, b = 3, and c = -70. \n\nSubstitute these values into the formula, we obtain two solutions w1 = 5 and w2 = -7. \nSince the width cannot be negative, we discard the solution w2 = -7. \nSo, the width of the garden is 5 meters. \n\nSubstituting w = 5 into the expression for the length, we obtain the length as 2*5 + 3 = 13 meters. \nTherefore, the dimensions of the garden are 5 meters by 13 meters."

In trapezoid BCED, base1 is BC = 20 units, base2 is ED = 20 units, and the height is AD = 10 units (since it's the same as AB, as ABCD is a rectangle). Therefore, the area of trapezoid BCED is (20 + 20) / 2 * 10 = 200 square units."

        "informal_proof": "Firstly, we need to add the number of cars John already has and the number of cars his friend gave him. So, 35 + 15 = 50 cars.

If the measure of the angle formed by the tool twice is represented by the equation 2x = y, where x represents the measure of the angle formed by the tool once and y represents the measure of the total angle formed by the tool twice, what should be the measure of the angle formed by the tool once (x) and twice (y) to set up the mirrors correctly?",
        "informal_proof": "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of x and y that satisfy the equation 2x = y and y = 75.

If she wants one angle of the triangle to be a right angle, and another angle to be 30 degrees, what should be the measure of the third angle in the triangle window?",
        "informal_proof": "To find the volume of the rectangular prism shaped tree house, we multiply the length, width, and height of the prism. So, the volume is 5 feet * 4 feet * 8 feet = 160 cubic feet. \n\nFor the triangular window, since the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, the measure of the third angle can be found by subtracting the known angles from 180 degrees. We know one angle is a right angle (90 degrees) and another angle is 30 degrees. So, the third angle is 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 30 degrees = 60 degrees."

Since there are 100 candies in total and 40 of them are blue, the proportion of blue candies to the total is 40/100. To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100.

So, we can't express the number of students studying both as a linear combination of A and B in this case."

According to the problem, the total number of fruits is 20. So we have the equation:\n\nx + 3x = 20\n\nBy solving this equation, we can find out the value of x, which will be the number of oranges, and 3x will be the number of apples. The solution of this equation is x = 5. So, John has 5 oranges and 15 apples."

The probability is then this number divided by the total number of students, which gives us 500/700 = 5/7.\n\n2. To find the probability that a student who took trigonometry also took statistics, we divide the number of students who took both (200) by the total number of students who took trigonometry (300).

        "informal_proof": "In the problem, we know that John rides his bike at a consistent speed of 10 kilometers per hour. In 5 hours of riding, he would normally cover a distance of 5 hours * 10 kilometers/hour = 50 kilometers. However, since he rode in the wrong direction for 2 hours, we can consider this as a negative distance from his starting point. So, the distance he covered in the wrong direction is 2 hours * 10 kilometers/hour = 20 kilometers. To find out how far he is from his starting point, we subtract the distance he rode in the wrong direction from the total distance he rode. So, the distance from his starting point is 50 kilometers - 20 kilometers = 30 kilometers. Therefore, John is 30 kilometers away from his starting point."

        "informal_proof": "We can solve this problem by setting up two equations based on the information given: \n\n1. The total number of glasses sold is 100. If we denote the number of glasses John sold as J and the number of glasses Sarah sold as S, we get the equation: J + S = 100.\n\n2. The total amount of money made is $410. Since John sells his lemonade for $5 per glass and Sarah sells hers for $3 per glass, we get the equation: 5J + 3S = 410.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by first multiplying the first equation by 3: 3J + 3S = 300. Then we subtract this equation from the second equation, which gives us: 2J = 110. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that J = 55. Substituting J = 55 into the first equation, we get: 55 + S = 100, so S = 45. \n\nSo, John sold 55 glasses of lemonade and Sarah sold 45 glasses of lemonade."

How many cups of lemonade and iced tea did John and Mary sell each day?",
        "informal_proof": "We can set up two systems of equations from the problem. \n\nOn the first day, let x be the number of cups of iced tea Mary sold and 2x be the number of cups of lemonade John sold. So, we have the equation x + 2x = 90, which simplifies to 3x = 90. Solving for x, we find x = 30.

The cost for John to produce the bookmarks is the initial $100 plus $2 per bookmark, so the cost function is C(x) = 2x + 100. The revenue from selling the bookmarks is $5 per bookmark, so the revenue function is R(x) = 5x.

Therefore, the volume of the water in the tank at a given time is V = 10 * 4 * h = 40h cubic meters, where h is the height of the water in meters.\n\nWe're told that the volume is increasing at a rate of 3 cubic meters per minute, so dV/dt = 3 cubic meters per minute.\n\nThe rate of change of the volume with respect to time is given by the derivative of the volume with respect to the height times the derivative of the height with respect to time. Therefore, we have the equation dV/dt = (dV/dh) * (dh/dt).\n\nWe solve this equation for dh/dt to find the rate at which the water level is rising. We have dV/dt = 40 * dh/dt, so dh/dt = dV/dt / 40 = 3 / 40 = 0.075 meters per minute.\n\nTherefore, the water level is rising at a rate of 0.075 meters per minute when the water is 1 m deep."

Therefore, multiplying y' - y = 0 by itself, we get (y' - y)(y' - y) = 0 which simplifies to y'' - 2y' + y^2 = 0. \n\nHowever, we need our second order equation to be linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients. Therefore, we need to replace the y^2 term with another constant. We can do this by substitifying y = e^x into the equation. This gives us y'' - 2y' + e^2x = 0. Now, we can see that e^2x is a constant for a specific x, so we can rewrite it as 2y, which gives us the desired second order equation: y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0. \n\nSo we have demonstrated that the general solution of the second order equation can be obtained from the general solution of the first order equation."

The given differential equation is dv/dt = 2t. We can rewrite this as dv = 2t dt. \n\nIntegrating both sides gives us ∫dv = ∫2t dt. The integral of dv is v, and the integral of 2t dt is t^2.

So, the only possible value for `x` is `x = π/4`.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of `A(x) = x * f(x)`, which is `A'(x) = f(x) - x * f'(x)`, where `f(x) = 600 - 2x` and `f'(x) = -2`.\n\nSubstituting `f(x)` and `f'(x)` into `A'(x)`, we get `A'(x) = 600 - 2x - x * (-2) = 600`.\n\nSetting `A'(x) = 0` gives `600 = 0`, which is not possible.

The derivative of this function is `A'(x) = 600 - 4x`, which is zero when `x = 150`. \n\nSo, the dimensions that will maximize the area of the field are a width of 150 meters and a length of 300 meters."

So, to calculate John's current Z-score, we subtract the average score 70 from John's score 80, and then divide by the standard deviation 10. Therefore, the Z-score for John's grade is (80-70)/10 = 1.\n\nNow if John wants his Z-score to be 2, we can use the formula Z = (X - μ)/σ, where Z is the Z-score, X is the score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation, to find out what his new score should be. Plugging 2 for Z, 70 for μ, and 10 for σ, we get X = Z*σ + μ = 2*10 + 70 = 90. So, John needs to score 90 to achieve a Z-score of 2."

        "informal_proof": "First we need to set up the equation that represents John's milkshake business. John makes $2 profit for each milkshake sold. This profit is then squared before he adds it to his total income. So for 'x' milkshakes, his income is $(2*x)^2$. \n\nGiven that his income at the end of the day is $144, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n(2*x)^2 = 144\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for 'x'. First, take the square root of both sides to get:\n\n2*x = 12\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, John sold 6 milkshakes that day."

The derivative of a function measures the rate at which the function's output (or 'y' value) is changing with respect to changes in the input (or 'x' value). \n\nThe derivative of f(x) can be found by applying basic rules of derivatives as follows:\nThe derivative of a constant is zero.\nThe derivative of x is 1.\nThe derivative of x² is 2x.\nThe derivative of a sum/difference of functions is the sum/difference of their derivatives.\n\nSo, we apply these rules to each term in f(x).

This is because the 8 students who like both subjects are counted twice in the sum of the students who like Mathematics and the students who like English. Then, subtract the number of students who were absent, that is, 5 (Mathematics) + 3 (English) equals 8 students. However, we can't simply subtract 8 from 22 because some students might like both subjects and are counted twice. As the problem states that no student who likes both subjects was absent, we subtract 8 from 22 to get 14. Then add the 8 students who like both subjects back, we get 22 students. However, we also need to consider the students who don't like either Mathematics or English. The total number of students is 30, so the number of students who don't like either subject is 30 - 22 = 8.

Solving for y, we subtract 1 from both sides to get x - 1 = 2y^2, then divide by 2 to get (x - 1)/2 = y^2.

        "informal_proof": "First of all, we need to understand the ratio of small bottles to large bottles. The ratio is 3:1, which means that for every 4 bottles, 3 are small and 1 is large. \n\nSince the factory makes 10000 bottles of juice, given the ratio, the number of small bottles will be (3/4) * 10000 = 7500, and the number of large bottles will be (1/4) * 10000 = 2500. \n\nNext, we calculate the total volume of the juice the factory produces. The total volume of juice in small bottles is 7500 * 250 mL = 1875000 mL, and the total volume of juice in large bottles is 2500 * 500 mL = 1250000 mL. \n\nFinally, we add these two volumes together to get the total amount of juice produced.

        "informal_proof": "Firstly, we need to find the rate at which salt is leaving the tank. Since the solution is well-mixed and drains at 4 liters/minute, the rate at which salt leaves the tank is 4 liters/minute * salt concentration = 4 * 0.4 = 1.6 kg/minute.\n\nSince no additional salt is entering the tank, the rate of change of the amount of salt in the tank is -1.6 kg/minute.\n\nTo find the amount of salt at time t = 10 minutes, we integrate the rate of change from 0 to 10. The integral of a constant is a linear function, so the integral of -1.6 from 0 to 10 is -1.6 * 10 = -16 kg.\n\nHowever, the amount of salt can't be negative, so we must have made an error. In fact, we forgot to consider the initial amount of salt in the tank, which was 50 liters * 0.4 kg/liter = 20 kg.\n\nAdding this to the change in the amount of salt, we find the amount of salt in the tank after 10 minutes is 20 kg - 16 kg = 4 kg."

This means that the number of students in the school can be expressed as the sum of the initial number of students and the product of the number of years that have passed and the annual increase in the number of students. \n\nMathematically, this relationship can be expressed as the equation S = 500 + 50 * Y, where S is the number of students in the school and Y is the number of years that have passed since the first year.\n\nTo verify that when the number of years is 10, the number of students in school is 1000, we simply substitute Y = 10 into the equation.

The rate at which salt enters the tank is 3 liters/minute * 0.02 kg/liter = 0.06 kg/minute. The rate at which salt leaves the tank is the volume of the mixture leaving per minute times the concentration of the salt in the tank at that time, which is 3 liters/minute * S(t) / 100 liters = 0.03*S(t) kg/minute.\n\nTherefore, we obtain the following differential equation:\n\ndS/dt = 0.06 - 0.03*S(t).\n\nWe can solve this differential equation using methods of integration.

        "informal_proof": "Firstly, we identify the number of students who play only one sport. This can be done by subtracting the number of students who play both sports from the total number of students who play each sport. \n\nThe number of students who only play basketball = total basketball players - students who play both sports = 100 - 50 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, the number of students who only play football = total football players - students who play both sports = 150 - 50 = 100.\n\nThe total number of students who play either sport (or both) = students who only play basketball + students who only play football + students who play both sports = 50 + 100 + 50 = 200.\n\nNow, to find out the number of students who do not participate in either sport, we subtract the total number of students who play either sport from the total number of students in the school.\n\nNumber of students who do not play either sport = total students - students who play either sport = 300 - 200 = 100.\n\nSo, there are 100 students who do not participate in either sport."

        "informal_proof": "First, we need to find the revenue function R(p). We have that R(p) = pD(p) = p(2000 - 100p) = 2000p - 100p^2.\n\nNext, we will find the cost function in terms of p. We know that D(p) = 2000 - 100p is the number of widgets, which is also x. So we can write x = 2000 - 100p. Substituting x into the cost function C(x) = 3000 + 50x, we get C(p) = 3000 + 50(2000 - 100p) = 3000 + 100000 - 5000p = 103000 - 5000p.\n\nNow, we can write the profit function P(p) = Revenue - Cost = R(p) - C(p) = (2000p - 100p^2) - (103000 - 5000p) = -100p^2 + 7000p - 103000.\n\nNext, we differentiate the profit function P(p) to find its maximum.

Given that there are twice as many red candies as blue candies and three times as many green candies as blue candies, we can express the total number of candies as `2B + B + 3B = 432`, where `B` represents the number of blue candies.

Similarly, Tom's score is 5 points because he hit 300 degrees (300 / 45 = 6.67, rounded down to 6 sections which is 5 points). So the total score after Tom and Jerry's turns is -3 + 5 = 2 points."

Let's use substitution:\n\nFirst, solve the first equation for L: L = 200 - T.\nThen, substitute L into the second equation: 0.5(200 - T) + 0.75T = 125.\nThis simplifies to 100 - 0.5T + 0.75T = 125, and then to 0.25T = 25. \nSo, T = 100.\n\nSubstitute T = 100 into the first equation: L + 100 = 200. This gives us L = 100. \n\nSo, Sally sold 100 cups of lemonade and Jane sold 100 cups of iced tea."

Since the farmer is using one side of her barn as one of the sides of the rectangle, we have the equation for the perimeter as 2x + y = 400. Solving for y, we get y = 400 - 2x. \n\nNow, we know the area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. So, the area A = xy = x(400 - 2x) = 400x - 2x^2. \n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the derivative of the area with respect to x, and set it equal to zero. The derivative of 400x - 2x^2 is 400 - 4x. Setting this equal to zero gives x = 100. \n\nSubstituting x = 100 back into the equation for y gives y = 400 - 2(100) = 200. \n\nSo, the dimensions that will give the largest area are a width of 100 feet and a length of 200 feet."

        "informal_proof": "The proportion of students studying science can be calculated by dividing the number of science students by the total number of students, which is 120/200 = 0.60.\n\nTo calculate the 95% confidence interval for this proportion, we first need to calculate the standard error of the proportion. The standard error (SE) is calculated by the formula √[ P(1 - P) / n ], where P is the sample proportion and n is the sample size. Substituting the given values in, we get SE = √[ 0.60(1 - 0.60) / 200 ] = 0.035.\n\nThe 95% confidence interval is calculated by the formula P ± Z*SE, where Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval, which is approximately 1.96. Substituting the values in, we get 0.60 ± 1.96*0.035 = (0.53, 0.67). Therefore, we are 95% confident that the true proportion of students studying science is between 0.53 and 0.67."

Then, given that the length is 5 meters more than twice the width, we can represent the length as 2x + 5. \n\nThe total length of the fence needed is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, which is twice the sum of the length and the width.

Find the rate of change of this distance at the time t = 3 seconds.",
        "informal_proof": "First, we need to find the function d(t). As the rocket moves up, the distance from the camera to the rocket forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the other two sides are the vertical height of the rocket and the horizontal distance between the camera and the launch point. By the Pythagorean theorem, d(t) = sqrt((500t^2)^2 + 2000^2).\n\nTo find the rate of change of this distance, we need to find the derivative of d(t) at t = 3. By the chain rule, the derivative of d(t) with respect to t is: \n\nd'(t) = 1/2 * (500t^2)^2 + 2000^2)^(-1/2) * 2 * 500t.\n\nEvaluating this at t = 3 gives: \n\nd'(3) = 1/2 * (500*3^2)^2 + 2000^2)^(-1/2) * 2 * 500 * 3 = 2250 m/s.\n\nSo, the rate of change of the distance between the rocket and the camera at t = 3 seconds is 2250 m/s."

If we add these parts of the ratio together, we get a total of 5 parts. \n\nNow, we know that there are total 450 students in the school. To find out how many students each part of the ratio represents, we divide the total number of students by the total parts of ratio. So, 450 divided by 5 equals to 90. \n\nTherefore, one part of the ratio represents 90 students. \n\nSince the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2, we multiply the number of parts for boys (which is 3) by the number of students each part represents (which is 90). So, 3 times 90 equals to 270. \n\nSimilarly, we multiply the number of parts for girls (which is 2) by the number of students each part represents (which is 90).

The derivative of the function f(x) is f'(x) = 6x^2 - 30x + 36. \n\nSetting f'(x) to 0, we get 6x^2 - 30x + 36 = 0 or x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0. \n\nFactoring the equation, we get (x-2)(x-3) = 0. \n\nSo, x = 2 or x = 3. \n\nAfter x=3 hours, the number of customers starts to decrease.

By using the properties of logarithms, we can write this equation as ln|y/x| = C. Taking the exponential of both sides gives y/x = e^C. But e^C is also an arbitrary constant, so we can write the solution as y = Cx."

We know that the length of the model is 3 inches, and the length of the actual building is 90 feet. To convert feet to inches (since the dimensions of the model are given in inches), we multiply 90 by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot), giving us 1080 inches. \n\nSo, the scale is 1080 (length of the actual building in inches) divided by 3 (length of the model in inches), which is 360. This means that 1 inch on the model corresponds to 360 inches on the actual building.\n\nGiven that the scale applies uniformly, the width of the actual building is 2 (width of the model in inches) times 360 (the scale), which is 720 inches or 60 feet (since 720 divided by 12 gives 60).

        "informal_proof": "We can set up two equations using the information given. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2w + 2l, where w is the width, and l is the length. We know that the total fencing available is 24 meters, so we can write the equation as 2w + 2l = 24. We also know from Mary's plan that the length is twice the width, so we can write this as l = 2w. \n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives us 2w + 2(2w) = 24, which simplifies to 2w + 4w = 24. Combining like terms gives us 6w = 24. Dividing each side by 6 gives us w = 4. Substituting this into the second equation gives us l = 2(4) = 8. \n\nSo the width of the playpen will be 4 meters, and the length will be 8 meters."

So, they found 4 + 6 = 10 feathers. \nThey decided to share all the feathers equally. Therefore, each person receives half of the total feathers. \nTo represent this as a fraction, we can see that half of 10 is 5. So each person receives 5 out of 10 feathers. \nIn terms of fractions, this is represented as 5/10. Hence, each person receives 5/10 of the total feathers."

This gives us 250 + 150 - 100 = 300 students who like either math or science.\nThe probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes. In this case, the total number of outcomes (students) is 400, and the number of favorable outcomes (students who like either math or science) is 300.

        "informal_proof": "Let's denote the width of the rectangle as x (in units). Therefore, the length of the rectangle can be denoted as x + 3 (in units). The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width, so we can create the following equation: x * (x + 3) = 28. \n\nFirst, expand the equation, which gives: x^2 + 3x - 28 = 0. This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it by factoring. The factors of 28 that add up to 3 are 7 and -4, so the factored form of the equation is (x - 4)(x + 7) = 0. \n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the potential solutions x = 4 and x = -7. However, a negative width does not make sense in this context, so we discard x = -7. Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 4 units, and the length is 4 + 3 = 7 units."

        "informal_proof": "Let's denote the number of cups John sold as J and the number of cups Maria sold as M. We can form two equations based on the problem.

If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get 2J + 2M = 200. We can then subtract this from the second equation to get J = 50. Substituting J = 50 into the first equation gives us 50 + M = 100, so M = 50. \n\nTherefore, John and Maria each sold 50 cups of lemonade."

If he enlarges the garden to a new length of 10 meters, what will the new width be? What is the increase in area and perimeter?",
        "informal_proof": "The original length and width of the garden are 4 meters and 6 meters respectively. The problem states that the new length will be proportional to the current length and the new width will be proportional to the current width. This means that the ratio of the new length to the old length should be the same as the ratio of the new width to the old width.\n\nThe new length is 10 meters, so the ratio of the new length to the old length is 10/4 = 2.5. Therefore, the new width should be 2.5 times the old width, which is 2.5 * 6 = 15 meters.\n\nThe original area of the garden is length times width, which is 4 * 6 = 24 square meters.

        "informal_proof": "First, we need to find the area of the garden itself, which is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: length times width. So, the area of the garden is 15 meters * 10 meters = 150 square meters.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the larger rectangle that includes both the garden and the path around it. The length of this larger rectangle is the length of the garden plus twice the width of the path (because the path is on both sides of the garden), which is 15 meters + 2*1 meter = 17 meters. Similarly, the width of the larger rectangle is the width of the garden plus twice the width of the path, which is 10 meters + 2*1 meter = 12 meters. So, the area of the larger rectangle is 17 meters * 12 meters = 204 square meters.\n\nFinally, to find the area of the path, we subtract the area of the garden from the area of the larger rectangle: 204 square meters - 150 square meters = 54 square meters.

        "informal_proof": "Firstly, we need to calculate how much Alice and Bob save each month. \n\nAlice saves 20% of her monthly allowance, which is $500. So, Alice's savings per month is 20/100 * $500 = $100. \n\nBob saves 25% of his monthly allowance, which is $400. So, Bob's savings per month is 25/100 * $400 = $100. \n\nAs we can see, both Alice and Bob save the same amount each month, which is $100. \n\nNow, let's calculate how much they save in a year. Since a year has 12 months, both of them will save 12 * $100 = $1200 for a year. \n\nTherefore, neither Alice nor Bob saves more in a year. They both save the same amount, which is $1200."

According to the problem, the team's total score for the season is 80 points/game * 20 games = 1600 points. The total points scored in the first 10 games is 74 points/game * 10 games = 740 points.

        "informal_proof": "Firstly, we know that a rectangle is a parallelogram with all angles equal to 90 degrees. This means that all properties of parallelograms apply to rectangles as well, including the property that opposite sides are equal in length. \n\nNow, let's consider the reflection over line EF. In a reflection, each point of the original figure has an image point in the reflected figure that is the same distance from the line of reflection, but on the opposite side. \n\nThis means that the distances from A to E, and from E to A' are equal, and similarly the distances from B to F and from F to B' are equal. \nThis implies that AA' = BB' = 2 times the length of AE (or BF), which is 2*2.5 = 5 units (since E and F are midpoints). \n\nSimilarly, we can argue that CC' and DD' are also 5 units long. \n\nNow, since the line of reflection EF is the line joining the midpoints of AB and BC, it is parallel to both AD and DC, and is half their length. After the reflection, EF will become the line joining the midpoints of A'B' and B'C', which is parallel to both A'D' and D'C', and is half their length. This implies that A'D' = DC = 10 units and D'C' = AD = 10 units.\n\nHence, we have shown that A'B' = AB, B'C' = BC, C'D' = CD and D'A' = DA, and all angles in A'B'C'D' are 90 degrees (since they are image angles of the 90-degree angles in ABCD after the reflection). \n\nTherefore, rectangle A'B'C'D' is congruent to rectangle ABCD by the definition of congruence (all corresponding sides and angles are equal)."

In such problems, the population at any given time is given by the formula P = P0 * (2^n), where P0 is the initial population, n is the number of time intervals, and 2 is the growth factor (since the population doubles every hour).\n\nHere, P0 = 1 (the initial population), and since the time from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM is 6 hours, n = 6.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get P = 1 * (2^6) = 64. \n\nSo, there will be 64 bacteria at 3:00 PM."

        "informal_proof": "First, we need to calculate the total area of the garden. This can be found by multiplying the length by the width, which is 12 meters * 5 meters = 60 square meters.\n\nNext, we find the total area of the four flower beds. Since each flower bed is 2 meters by 1 meter, the area of one flower bed is 2 meters * 1 meter = 2 square meters. Therefore, the total area of the four flower beds is 4 * 2 square meters = 8 square meters.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total area of the flower beds from the total area of the garden to find the remaining area.

Therefore, the circumference of the semi-circle is 10π meters. \n\nSince the farmer will place a post every meter, the total number of posts required is equal to the circumference, which is 10π. Since π≈3.14, we can estimate that around 31 posts are needed.\n\nFor the first 20 posts, the cost is simply 20*$20=$400.\n\nFor the remaining 11 posts (31-20), the cost doubles for each post. This can be considered as a geometric sequence, where the first term is $40 (double the original cost), and the common ratio is 2. The sum of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula a(1-r^n)/(1-r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Substituting into the formula, the total cost for the remaining 11 posts is $40(1-2^11)/(1-2)= -81,920. \n\nHowever, because the cost can't be negative, we take the absolute value, which is $81,920.\n\nAdding up the cost for the first 20 posts and the remaining 11 posts, the total cost for the farmer is $400+$81,920=$82,320."

But we also have to account for the whole number places. Since there are no whole numbers in either 0.75 or 0.25, the whole number part of the sum is 0. \n\nAdding the whole number part to the decimal part, we get 0+0.95 = 0.95. But this is not equal to 1 as required. We made a mistake in the addition of the tenths place. The correct sum of 7 and 2 is 9, but since we are dealing with tenths, it should be written as 0.9 and the 1 carries over to the ones place, making the sum 1.0 instead of 0.95.

According to the rules of exponents, squaring a binomial (a + b)^2 means multiplying (a + b) by itself, i.e., (a + b) * (a + b). \n\nWe then use the distributive property of multiplication over addition, which states that for any real numbers x, y, and z, x*(y + z) = x*y + x*z. Applying this property twice to our equation gives us: a*a + a*b + b*a + b*b.\n\nNow, since multiplication is commutative (meaning that for any real numbers x and y, x*y = y*x), we can say that a*b = b*a. Therefore, a*a + a*b + b*a + b*b simplifies to a^2 + ab + ab + b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, which is the right side of our original equation. \n\nTherefore, we have shown that for any real numbers a and b, (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2."

        "informal_proof": "Firstly, we notice that the number of flowers increases by 2 from one row to the next.

The average errors of volume calculations for Group A and Group B are 2.5cc and 2.2cc, respectively, and the standard deviations are 0.3cc and 0.5cc, respectively.\n\nIs there a significant difference in the accuracy of volume calculation between the two groups? Use a two-tailed t-test with a 5% significance level to determine.",
        "informal_proof": "First, we need to calculate the volumes of the rectangular prism and the cube. The volume of the rectangular prism is length * width * height = 4cm * 3cm * 3cm = 36 cubic cm. The volume of the cube is side length^3 = 3cm^3 = 27 cubic cm. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the t-value for the two-sample t-test. The formula for the t-value is:\n\nt = (Mean1 - Mean2) / sqrt [(s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2)]\n\nwhere:\nMean1 and Mean2 are the means of the two samples,\ns1 and s2 are the standard deviations of the two samples,\nn1 and n2 are the sizes of the two samples.\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\nt = (2.5cc - 2.2cc) / sqrt [(0.3cc^2/50) + (0.5cc^2/60)] \nt = 0.3cc / sqrt [(0.09cc/50) + (0.25cc/60)]\nt = 0.3cc / sqrt [0.0018cc + 0.00417cc]\nt = 0.3cc / sqrt [0.00597cc]\nt = 0.3cc / 0.07728cc\nt = 3.88\n\nThen, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed t-test with a 5% significance level and degrees of freedom = n1 + n2 - 2 = 50 + 60 - 2 = 108. From the t-distribution table, the critical t-value is approximately 1.98.\n\nSince the calculated t-value (3.88) is greater than the critical t-value (1.98), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the accuracy of volume calculation between the two groups.

        "informal_proof": "Firstly, we need to find out how many students play either football or basketball. To do so, we add the number of football players (10) to the number of basketball players (15). However, since there are students who play both sports, we're double counting those, so we have to subtract the number of students who play both sports (5). This gives us 20 students who play either football or basketball.\n\nThe probability of a random event can be calculated by dividing the number of ways the event can occur by the total number of outcomes. In this case, the event is a student playing either football or basketball, and the total number of outcomes is the total number of students.

Since water is being pumped into the pot at a rate of 1 liter per minute, the amount of coffee being added to the pot is 0 grams per minute, as the water being pumped in contains no coffee.\n\nThe amount of coffee being drained from the pot is equal to the current concentration of coffee in the pot (A(t) grams per liter) times the rate at which the mixture is draining (1 liter per minute).\n\nSo, the rate of change in the amount of coffee A(t) can be described by the differential equation dA/dt = 0 - A(t)."

        "informal_proof": "This problem is about linear regression, where the slope (2.5 points per hour) indicates the rate of increase in test scores for each additional hour of study. Alice studied for 5 hours and scored 70 points. Hence, assuming the relationship between study hours and test scores is linear and there's no other variable contributing to the test score, we can calculate Bob's expected score.\n\nWe know that each additional hour of study increases the test score by 2.5 points. Therefore, if Bob studied one hour less than Alice, his score would be expected to be 2.5 points less than Alice's score. So we can subtract 2.5 from Alice's score of 70 points to find Bob's expected score: 70 - 2.5 = 67.5. \n\nTherefore, Bob's expected score is 67.5 points."

The formula for the standard error of the difference in sample means (SE_D) is sqrt[(s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2)]. Plugging in the given values, we get SE_D = sqrt[(5^2/50) + (7^2/100)] = sqrt[0.5 + 0.49] = sqrt[0.99] = 0.99499.\n\nThe confidence interval is given by the formula: D ± z*SE_D.

This remaining amount must be equal to 27 candies, so we can set up the equation 3/32*C=27. By solving this equation, we find that C=27*(32/3)=288. So there were 288 candies in the box originally."

        "informal_proof": "First, we need to compute the expected frequencies. \n\nThe probability of a student passing is 200/300 = 0.67 and failing is 0.33. \n\nThus, for Science students, the expected frequencies are:\n- Pass: 200 students * (200/300) = 133.33\n- Fail: 100 students * (100/300) = 33.33\n\nFor Arts students, the expected frequencies are:\n- Pass: 200 students * (120/300) = 80\n- Fail: 100 students * (80/300) = 26.67\n\nNow, we can compute the chi-square test statistic as:\n\nChi-square = ∑ [ (O-E)^2 / E ]\n\nChi-square = (150-133.33)^2 / 133.33 + (50-33.33)^2 / 33.33 + (120-80)^2 / 80 + (80-26.67)^2 / 26.67"

        "informal_proof": "1. The derivative of a function gives us the rate at which the function is changing at any given point. To find the derivative of P(x) = 4x^2 - 16x + 25, we use the power rule (which states that the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1)), and the constant rule (which states that the derivative of a constant is zero). Applying these rules, we get P'(x) = 8x - 16.\n\n2. To find the quantity of units that maximizes profit, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x. \n   So, 8x - 16 = 0. Solving for x gives us x = 2. \n   Therefore, the maximum profit is achieved when the company produces and sells 2 thousand units.\n\n3. Quantitatively, if we plot the function P(x) and its derivative P'(x), we will see that P(x) is a parabola that opens upwards and reaches its maximum at x = 2. This is where the derivative P'(x) crosses the x-axis. The graph of P'(x) is a straight line that intersects the x-axis at x = 2, which means the rate of change of profit is zero at this point, indicating a maximum."

How much did he miscalculate by?",
        "informal_proof": "First, we need to find out how long it would take to paint the house if John and Mike worked together. \n\nJohn can paint a house in 5 hours, which means his rate of work is 1 house per 5 hours, or 1/5 of a house per hour. Mike can paint a house in 7 hours, which means his rate of work is 1 house per 7 hours, or 1/7 of a house per hour. \n\nIf they work together, their rates of work add up. Therefore, they can paint 1/5 + 1/7 = 12/35 of a house per hour. To find out how long it would take to paint the whole house, we need to take the reciprocal of this rate, which is 35/12 hours, or approximately 2.92 hours. \n\nSecond, we need to calculate how much John miscalculated his revenue by.

        "informal_proof": "First, we need to calculate the population of rats at the end of 30 days before the poison is introduced. This can be done using the formula for exponential growth: P = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where P0 is the initial population, r is the rate of growth, and t is time. \n\nSubstituting the given values, we get P = 100 * (1 + 0.05)^30. \n\nNext, we calculate the population after the poison is introduced.

Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, and he has 9 quarters, we multiply 25 cents by 9 and get 225 cents, or $2.25. \n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of money John has in quarters from the total amount of money he has. This gives us the amount of money he has in dimes. $3.25 - $2.25 = $1.00. \n\nFinally, since each dime is worth 10 cents, we divide $1.00 by 10 cents to find out how many dimes John has. $1.00 divided by 10 cents is 10, so John has 10 dimes."

        "informal_proof": "First, we need to calculate the volume of the original box and the volume of the new box.

        "informal_proof": "The number of votes John and Lisa get each week can be represented by a linear equation of the form y = mx + b, where y is the number of votes, x is the week number, m is the slope of the line (the number of additional votes each week), and b is the y-intercept (the number of votes in the first week).\n\nFor John, the number of votes he got in the first week (x=1) is 30 and in the second week (x=2) is 35, so we can set up two equations 30 = m*1 + b and 35 = m*2 + b. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives m = 5. Substituting m = 5 into the first equation gives b = 25. So John's vote count can be described by the equation y = 5x + 25.\n\nFor Lisa, the number of votes she got in the first week (x=1) is 20 and in the second week (x=2) is 30, so we can set up two equations 20 = m*1 + b and 30 = m*2 + b. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives m = 10. Substituting m = 10 into the first equation gives b = 10. So Lisa's vote count can be described by the equation y = 10x + 10."

The area of the original square plot is x² (in square meters), which is also the number of apple trees the farmer can originally plant.\n\nAccording to the problem, if the farmer increases each side of the square by 3 meters, the new length of each side will be x+3 (in meters), and the area of the new square plot will be (x+3)² (in square meters). According to the problem, this area is 12 more than the original area, so we have the equation (x+3)² = x² + 12.\n\nSolving this equation will provide the length of each side of the original square plot. \n\nTo solve, first expand the left side of the equation: (x+3)² = x² + 6x + 9.\n\nThen subtract x² from both sides: 6x + 9 = 12.\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides: 6x = 3.\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 6: x = 3 / 6 = 0.5.\n\nSo, the length of each side of the original square plot is 0.5 meters."

Since the total number of tickets sold was 200, we can write down the following equation based on the given information: `a + s = 200`. \n\nThe total income from selling these tickets was $1200.

Prove that the number of students who enjoy Mathematics is 60 and those who do not enjoy Mathematics is 80.",

Let's represent the number of students who enjoy Mathematics as 3x and those who don't as 2x.\n\nSubstituting these values into the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\n(3x)² + (2x)² = 100²\n9x² + 4x² = 10000\n13x² = 10000\nx² = 10000 / 13\nx = sqrt(10000 / 13)\nx = 10sqrt(100 / 13)\nx = 10sqrt(100 / 13) * sqrt(13 / 13)\nx = 10sqrt(1300 / 169)\nx = 10*sqrt(1300) / sqrt(169)\nx = 10*36 / 13\nx = 360 / 13\nx = ~27.7\n\nSo the number of students who enjoy Mathematics is 3x = 3 * 27.7 = ~83.1, and the number of students who do not enjoy Mathematics is 2x = 2 * 27.7 = ~55.4.\n\nHowever, since the number of students cannot be a decimal, it seems there might be a mistake in the problem.

        "informal_proof": "To determine the intervals of increase and decrease for the function f(x) = -2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 1, we first need to find its derivative.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = -6x^2 + 6x - 4. This derivative tells us the rate of change of the function at any given point x. When the derivative is positive, the function is increasing; when it's negative, the function is decreasing.\n\nTo find the critical points of the function, where it changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n-6x^2 + 6x - 4 = 0\n\nThis equation can be simplified to:\n\nx^2 - x + 2/3 = 0.\n\nBy applying the quadratic formula, we find:\n\nx = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(2/3))] / 2\n\nHowever, the term under the square root (the discriminant) is negative, indicating that there are no real roots. Hence, the function does not have any critical points.\n\nSo, we can conclude that the function f(x) = -2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 1 is always decreasing for all real numbers since its derivative is always negative."

Similarly, the contribution per student in Class B is $2000 / 40 = $50, and the contribution per student in Class C is $2500 / 50 = $50.\n\nThis means that the rate of contribution per student is constant across all classes and is equal to $50 per student.\n\nSo, the polynomial that represents the relationship between the number of students in a class (n) and the amount of money contributed by that class is P(n) = 50n.\n\nNow, to find the amount of money that would be contributed by a class with 60 students, we substitute n = 60 into the polynomial: P(n) = 50 * 60 = $3000.\n\nTherefore, a class with 60 students would contribute $3000 to the charity event."

If the original basis is the standard basis in R^50, the professor chooses a new basis to be the set of all vectors where the number of weekly steps are increased by 10% for each student. \n\nThe professor asks a question: If a student originally had a weekly steps count of 7000, what will be his/her weekly steps count in the new basis?",
        "informal_proof": "In the new basis, all vectors have their components increased by 10%. Therefore, if a student originally had a weekly steps count of 7000, his/her weekly steps count in the new basis will be increased by 10% of 7000. To calculate 10% of 7000, we multiply 7000 by 0.1, which equals 700. Therefore, the student's weekly steps count in the new basis will be 7000 + 700 = 7700."

        "informal_proof": "To express this situation using a variable, we can write an expression: `a + 10 - 5`, where 'a' is the number of apples Alice initially has. This expression first adds 10 to 'a', which represents Alice buying 10 more apples, and then subtracts 5, which represents Alice giving 5 apples to her friend. If Alice initially had 15 apples, we can substitute 'a' with 15 in the expression, and we get `15 + 10 - 5`. The expression simplifies to 25 - 5, and then to 20. So, Alice has 20 apples left."

        "informal_proof": "The student is trying to determine whether the slope of his linear regression is significantly different from zero. In this case, the slope represents the change in exam scores for each additional hour studied.\n\nA 95% confidence interval for the slope of a regression line can be calculated using the formula: slope ± (t-value * standard error), where the t-value for a 95% confidence interval with a large sample size is approximately 1.96.\n\nIn this case, the slope is 2 and the standard error is 0.5. Thus, the 95% confidence interval for the slope is 2 ± (1.96 * 0.5). This results in a confidence interval of (2 - 0.98, 2 + 0.98), or (1.02, 2.98).\n\nBecause this confidence interval does not include zero, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between the number of hours studied and the final exam score. In other words, the increase in exam scores for each additional hour studied is significantly different from zero. \n\nThe concept of derivatives comes into play because the slope of the regression line represents the rate of change of the exam scores with respect to the number of hours studied, which is a derivative. In this case, the derivative is significantly different from zero, indicating that there is a significant rate of change."

        "informal_proof": "Let's set up two equations based on the information given. \n\n1) The first equation comes from the total number of coins. John has both dimes and quarters in his piggy bank, so the equation will be D + Q = 30, where D is the number of dimes and Q is the number of quarters.\n\n2) The second equation comes from the total value of the coins. Each dime is worth $0.10 and each quarter is worth $0.25. So the equation will be 0.10D + 0.25Q = 5.50.\n\nTo solve these equations, we can first multiply the second equation by 100 to get rid of the decimals. This gives us 10D + 25Q = 550. Then, multiply the first equation by 10 to make the coefficients of D in both equations the same, getting 10D + 10Q = 300.\n\nNow we can subtract the first equation from the second to find the value of Q. This gives us 15Q = 250, so Q = 250 / 15 = 16.67. But the number of coins has to be an integer, so we round Q to the nearest whole number, which is 17.\n\nSubstitute Q = 17 into the first equation, we get D + 17 = 30, so D = 30 - 17 = 13.\n\nSo, John has 13 dimes and 17 quarters in his piggy bank."

        "informal_proof": "We can solve this problem using a system of equations. \n\nLet's denote the number of cubes as C and the number of pyramids as P. \n\nFrom the problem, we get two equations:\n\n1) C + P = 45 (since the total number of cubes and pyramids is 45)\n\n2) 6C + 5P = 235 (since each cube has 6 faces and each pyramid has 5 faces and they total 235)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations step by step. \n\nFirst, we can solve the first equation for C: C = 45 - P.\n\nThen, we substitute C in the second equation: 6*(45 - P) + 5P = 235. \n\nThis simplifies to 270 - 6P + 5P = 235, which further simplifies to P = 35. \n\nSubstituting P = 35 into the first equation gives us C = 45 - 35 = 10. \n\nTherefore, there are 10 cubes and 35 pyramids in the classroom."

We can rearrange this equation to fit our variables: n = mp + b.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that m = -5. So, the equation becomes n = -5p + b.\n\nSubstitute the known point (2, 30) into the equation to solve for b: 30 = -5(2) + b. Solving this equation, we find that b = 40.\n\nSo, the equation of the line that expresses the relationship between the price of lemonade and the number of cups sold is n = -5p + 40."

So the total width is 30+6 = 36 feet. The length of the garden will be 50 feet plus 2 times the width of the path, which is also 2*3 feet = 6 feet. So the total length is 50+6 = 56 feet. \n\nThe area of the rectangle including the path is length times width, which is 36 feet * 56 feet = 2016 square feet. \n\nNext, we subtract the area of the garden without the path. The area of the garden is 30 feet * 50 feet = 1500 square feet. \n\nSo the area of the path is the total area minus the garden area, which is 2016 square feet - 1500 square feet = 516 square feet.

The area of a rectangle is calculated as length * width, so the area of the park is 50m * 30m = 1500 sq.m. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 * (length + width), so the perimeter of the park is 2 * (50m + 30m) = 160m.\n\nNext, we calculate the area and perimeter of the larger rectangle that includes both the park and the pathway. The length and width of this larger rectangle are each 10m (2 * 5m) greater than the park due to the pathway on both sides. So, the length is 60m and the width is 40m. The area of the larger rectangle is therefore 60m * 40m = 2400 sq.m and its perimeter is 2 * (60m + 40m) = 200m.\n\nFinally, we subtract the area and perimeter of the park from the area and perimeter of the larger rectangle to find the area and perimeter of the pathway. The area of the pathway is 2400 sq.m - 1500 sq.m = 900 sq.m. The perimeter of the pathway is actually the same as the perimeter of the larger rectangle, so it’s 200m."

We can use the formula for exponential growth, which is P = P0 * e^(kt), where P is the final population, P0 is the initial population, k is the growth rate, and t is the time.\n\nGiven that the population doubles every hour, we can say that k = ln(2), because e^(ln(2)) = 2. \n\nNow, we know that 3 hours ago there were 8 bacteria, so if we want to know how many there will be in 5 hours, we have to add 3 to 5, because the 5 hours are counted from now, not from 3 hours ago. \n\nSo, we have P0 = 8, k = ln(2), and t = 8. \n\nPlugging these values into our formula gives us:\n\nP = 8 * e^(ln(2) * 8) = 8 * 2^8 = 8 * 256 = 2048.\n\nSo in 5 hours, there will be 2048 bacteria."

The problem states that the length is twice the width. \n\nNext, we deal with the concept of perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + width). We know from the problem that the perimeter is 36 meters.

Solving for width, we get width = 6 meters.\n\nNow that we know the width, we can find the length by multiplying the width by 2.

We can represent this relationship with the equation S = 15t + 50, where S is the total amount of savings, and t is the time in weeks. This equation says that each week (for each increment of t), John adds $15 to his savings, and he started with $50. \n\nTo find out how much money John will have after 10 weeks, we substitute t = 10 into the equation, giving us S = 15*10 + 50 = 150 + 50 = 200.

        "informal_proof": "The original area of the garden is 15 feet * 10 feet = 150 square feet. To double the area, the new area should be 2*150 = 300 square feet. \n\nIf we extend the length and width by x feet, the new dimensions will be (15+x) feet and (10+x) feet. \n\nSo, we can set up the equation (15+x) * (10+x) = 300 to find the value of x. \n\nFirst, expand the equation: \n\n    15*10 + 15*x + 10*x + x^2 = 300\n    150 + 25x + x^2 = 300\n    x^2 + 25x - 150 = 0\n\nThen, factor the quadratic equation: \n\n    (x - 5)(x + 30) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions x = 5 and x = -30. \n\nSince the length and width cannot be negative, x = 5 is the valid solution. \n\nTherefore, to double the area of the garden, you need to extend the length and width by 5 feet."

        "informal_proof": "Let's denote the width of the park as x (in meters). According to the problem, the length of the park is twice the width, so it can be represented as 2x.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula: 2*(length + width). In our case, the perimeter is 120 meters, so we can set up the following equation: 2*(x + 2x) = 120. \nSolving this equation, we get x = 20. Therefore, the width of the park is 20 meters, and the length is 2*20 = 40 meters."

To do this, they need to evaluate the area under the normal distribution curve from 8 hours to infinity. In mathematics, this area is obtained by integrating the normal distribution function from the given point (8 hours in this case) to infinity.\n\nThe probability density function of a normal distribution is given by:\n\nf(x) = (1/√(2πσ²)) * e^(-((x-μ)²/2σ²))\n\nwhere μ is the mean (6 hours) and σ is the standard deviation (1.5 hours).\n\nCan you calculate the integral ∫ from 8 to ∞ of f(x) dx?",

The solution to this equation can be found by integrating both sides with respect to 't'.

So the actual number of trees in the park is 145 - 110 = 35 trees."

The integral of `r(t) = 3t^2 + 2t + 1` from 0 to 10 can be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, let's find the antiderivative of `r(t)`. The antiderivative of `3t^2` is `t^3`, the antiderivative of `2t` is `t^2`, and the antiderivative of `1` is `t`. So the antiderivative of `r(t)` is `t^3 + t^2 + t`.\n\nWe evaluate this at `t = 10` and `t = 0` and subtract the latter from the former to find the definite integral.

Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can multiply the length by 2 and the width by 2, then add those two results together. In this case, we multiply 3 meters (the length) by 2 to get 6 meters, and 2 meters (the width) by 2 to get 4 meters. Adding 6 meters and 4 meters together gives us 10 meters.

        "informal_proof": "The growth of the bee population forms a straight line on a graph, which means it increases at a constant rate. This rate can be determined by finding the slope of the line, which is the change in the number of bees divided by the change in time. From the first day to the seventh day, the number of bees increases from 20 to 80, a change of 60 bees. The time changes from the first day to the seventh day, a change of 6 days. Therefore, the slope of the line, or the rate of increase of the bee population, is 60/6 = 10 bees per day. To find the number of bees on the 15th day, we can start with the number of bees on the first day, 20, and add the product of the rate of increase (10 bees per day) and the time from the first day to the 15th day (15-1 = 14 days).

The first equation becomes 3x + 2(2x - 5) = 12. \n\nSolving this for x, we distribute the 2 inside the parenthesis to get 3x + 4x - 10 = 12. Combining like terms, we get 7x - 10 = 12.

        "informal_proof": "First, let's find the total number of students who play either basketball or soccer, or both. We add the number of students who play basketball and the number who play soccer, and then subtract the students who play both (to avoid counting them twice). So, the total is 12 (basketball) + 8 (soccer) - 2 (both) = 18 students.\n\nThe number of students who don't play either basketball or soccer is then the total number of students in the class minus the number who play one of the sports: 30 (total) - 18 (either sport) = 12 students.\n\nThe probability that a student picked at random doesn't play either sport is the number of students who don't play either sport divided by the total number of students. So, the probability is 12 (neither sport) / 30 (total) = 0.4."

        "informal_statement": "A cube has a side length of 3 cm. This cube undergoes a geometric transformation, where each side length is doubled. What is the volume of the new cube?",
        "informal_proof": "The volume of a cube is given by the cube of its side length. In the original cube, the volume is 3 cm * 3 cm * 3 cm = 27 cubic cm. \n\nAfter the transformation, the side length of the cube is doubled, so the new side length is 3 cm * 2 = 6 cm. The volume of the new cube is therefore 6 cm * 6 cm * 6 cm = 216 cubic cm."

        "informal_statement": "Given two fractions 3/4 and 2/3, find the sum of these fractions and then subtract 1/2 from the result.",
        "informal_proof": "First, we add the fractions 3/4 and 2/3. They have different denominators, so we find a common denominator which is 12. We convert the fractions into their equivalent forms with denominator 12, resulting in 9/12 and 8/12. Adding them together gives us 17/12.\n\nNext, we subtract 1/2 from 17/12. Again, we need to convert the fractions to have the same denominator, which is 12. So 1/2 becomes 6/12. Subtracting 6/12 from 17/12 gives us 11/12. \n\nSo, the answer is 11/12."

        "informal_proof": "The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two equal lengths and two equal widths, we can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length by 2 and the width by 2 and then adding those together. \n\nGiven that the length of the rectangle is 5 meters and the width is 3 meters, the total length of the fence needed would be 2*5 meters (for the lengths) plus 2*3 meters (for the widths), which equals 10 meters plus 6 meters, or 16 meters."

        "informal_proof": "Emily spends $1.50 on the triangle-shaped candy and $2.75 on the circle-shaped candy. If we add these two amounts together, we get the total amount Emily spends. By doing the addition $1.50 + $2.75, we get $4.25. Therefore, Emily spends $4.25 in total."
