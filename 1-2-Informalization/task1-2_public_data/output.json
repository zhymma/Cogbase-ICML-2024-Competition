        "solution": "To calculate the total distance traveled by a car, we need to add the distance it covered in the first part of the journey (21/4 miles) to the distance it covered in the second part of the journey (5/2 miles). \n\nAdding 21/4 miles and 5/2 miles, we get 31/4 miles in total.

        "solution": "Let's represent the initial amount of money in Jack's bank account by the variable x. The problem can be modeled by a one-step equation. Jack spent $30 on a book and then deposited $50, resulting in his account balance being $120. \n\nBy setting up the equation x - 30 + 50 = 120, we can solve for the initial amount of money in Jack's account. \n\nCombining like terms, we simplify the equation to x + 20 = 120. \n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we isolate x to find x = 100. Therefore, Jack initially had $100 in his bank account."
